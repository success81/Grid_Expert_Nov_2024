Expert Grid AI

I am building an AI that gives expert advice. It’s called Expert grid AI. I built something similar called Problem solver AI. So it will be almost identical. With Expert Grid AI the only   Abstract Concepts and Principles, Professions, Ancient Civilizations and cultures, Professions, Ages and professions- I’m attaching the examples of the experts. These are examples so the you can learn you can use these but you should come up with your own this is just to teach. Use this code I’ve attached to create this app. It should be very similar. I will load the experts file in the root folder and Call it experts.txt

The screen should have the key questions

What main question or problem would you like advice on today? (Mandatory)

Detail level desired (Mandatory)
-Quick overview, step-by-step information, in-depth analysis

Other relevant information (optional)


This will be a radio dial selection (mandatory)
Focused Expert Mode- Only experts that directly relate to the problem or question
Creative Expert Mode- Experts that have little or no relation to the problem but may be able to bring you a different perspective
Mixed Expert Mode- A mixture of Focused and Creative experts



——

The AI will follow-up with 4 selected questions to get more context 



—

If they chose Focused mode they will give only provide 4 experts that are directly related to the question

The creative expert mode. The AI will make a random list of 50 experts. It will then choose 4 experts from that list

Mixed expert mode will have 2 randoms and 2 focused

-

The outcome will be an intro addressing the overall problem

Each expert will have one full prompt 

And the intro will be a prompt






Problem Solving AI concept

Screen 1

The AI will take in initial information. There will be a pulldown where it has them choose from these overall topics - Decision Making, General Problem Solving, Strategic Planning, Risk Assessment, Contingency Planning, Conflict Resolution, Brainstorming, Creative Problem Solving, other

Here are the other fields. -

What are you trying to accomplish?

What are the key question/questions you are trying to answer?

Who are the key stakeholders and how are they related to this?

What constraints or limitations exist?

What are your top priorities related to this?

What resources are available to you related to this?

Related Information


Screen 2-

Based on the information given the AI will create 5-10 follow-questions. They will be labeled Q1, Q2,Q3,…. Etc. The person will answer them. 1. Answer, 2. Answer, 3. Answer. The AI will then take this information in and create a 10 chapter outline with the solution. The outline will also have an intro and a closing


Screen 3-

This chapter outline will then be presented to the user. A final opportunity will be given to the human to give feedback



Screen 4- 
Taking all the feedback. The AI will run a prompt on each chapter and the intro and closing
